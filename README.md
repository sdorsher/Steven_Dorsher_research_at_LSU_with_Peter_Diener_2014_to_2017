# Steven_Dorsher_research_at_LSU_with_Peter_Diener_2014_to_2017
I ported Peter Diener's FORTRAN code at his request to C++. This code models an Extreme Mass Ratio Black Hole Binary Inspiral on a Schwartzschild background using the Scalar Self Force approximation with an effective source. In this directory is a lot of my work toward my general exam paper that formed the basis for my masters.
